# üì¶ Digit Crud Bloc

This package provides the core logic and services for managing entity-based data flows in a modular and extensible way. It supports dynamic entity mapping, relationship traversal, nested field resolution, and repository-driven CRUD operations.

---

## üß† Key Concepts

### üîÅ Relationship Graph
- Maintains bidirectional relationship mappings between entity models.
- Enables efficient traversal and lookup across related entities.

### üåø Nested Model Mappings
- Allows mapping nested fields from complex models (e.g., mapping `Individual.address.locality.code`).
- Enables powerful filtering and selection in search queries.

## üî® Core Features

### `CrudService`
A centralized service that orchestrates:
- Entity creation, update, and deletion
- Relationship-based queries
- Repository resolution per entity type

#### Constructor Params
- `relationshipMap`: List of `RelationshipMapping` objects defining entity links.
- `nestedModelMappings`: List of `NestedModelMapping` for deep field resolution.
- Repositories for each supported entity: `Household`, `Individual`, `HouseholdMember`, `ProjectBeneficiary`, `Task`.

#### Public Methods
- `init()`: Initializes relationship graph and nested mapping lookup.
- `searchEntities(query)`: Performs a global search using filters, pagination, and nested field resolution.
- `createEntities(entities)`: Creates a list of entities using their mapped repository.
- `updateEntities(entities)`: Updates a list of entities.
- `deleteEntities(entities)`: Deletes a list of entities.

---

## üß© Modular Helpers

- `QueryBuilder`: SQL and filter utilities for query construction and argument building.
- `HydrationHelper`: Handles hydration of nested model data.
- `RelationshipGraphHelper`: Finds relationship paths between models for advanced queries.

## üèóÔ∏è Required Setup

Before using any CRUD features, you **must** initialize the singleton with all required dependencies:

```dart
CrudBlocSingleton.instance.setData(
  crudService: myCrudService,
  dynamicEntityModelListener: myListener,
);
```

## üîÅ CRUD Operations

The `CrudService` supports full **CRUD operations** for all supported entity types. Internally, it resolves the appropriate repository based on the runtime type of the entity.

### 1. **Create**
Registers new entities to local storage.

```dart
await crudService.createEntities(entities);
```

Internally calls repository.create(entity) for each entity. Suitable for bulk registration of household, members, tasks, etc.

### 2. **Read (Search)**
Performs global or scoped search on entities using relationships and nested fields.
```dart
final searchParams = GlobalSearchParameters(
  filters: [
    SearchFilter(
      root: 'household',
      field: 'clientReferenceId',
      operator: 'equals',
      value: 'HOUSEHOLD-1234',
    ),
  ],
  primaryModel: 'household',
  select: [
    'individual',
    'household',
    'householdMember',
    'projectBeneficiary',
    'task',
  ],
  pagination: PaginationParams(limit: 10, offset: 0),
);

// Perform the global search
final (results, totalCount) =
    await crudService.searchEntities(query: searchParams);
```

Uses SearchEntityRepository.
Supports filters, pagination, relationship traversal, and nested field lookup.

### 3. **Update**
Updates existing entities in the local repository.

```dart
await crudService.updateEntities(updatedEntities);
```

Calls repository.update(entity) for each provided entity.
Supports batch updates for any entity type.

### 4. **Delete**
Deletes entities from the local repository.

```dart
await crudService.deleteEntities(entitiesToDelete);
```

Calls repository.delete(entity) for each entity.
