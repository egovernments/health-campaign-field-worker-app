### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Currently **tightly coupled to the `registration_delivery` package** for model definitions.
- Only supports entity models provided by `registration_delivery`.

---

### üî≠ Future Scope

- Decouple model and repository logic through abstract interfaces or contracts.
- Make the package **framework-agnostic** and reusable across different domains or modules.
